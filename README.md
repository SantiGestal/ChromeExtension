# Chrome Extension

## Motivation
Many times we enter time-wasting websites unconsciously, driven by habit. This is a chrome extension I made to help me overcome this issue. The idea is to pause and breathe for a couple seconds before entering the website, and ask for confirmation to continue, thus giving awareness of the situtation.

## Features

### Select distracting websites
Simply paste the url's of those websites which you feel are distracting onto the extension popup.

### Add motivational quote
ThereÂ´s the possibility of adding your own motivational quotes to the loading screen. These will show up when the breathing timer is over. Otherwise, predefined quotes will appear.
